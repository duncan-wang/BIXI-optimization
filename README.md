# BIXI-optimization
Route optimization for bike rebalancing within the BIXI bike-sharing system

This zip file contains the codes for data preprocessing, visualization and three optimization models we covered in our report. Raw datasets were obtained from BIXI Open Data. All datasets necessary for the demo problem in the report are stored in their respective folder. Note that we refer to our base model as Problem 1, operation time minimization extension as Problem 2 and Prioritized routing as Problem 3.
